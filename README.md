# minazaosd-new

MinimOSD project based on minazaosd.
Implementing the FrSky telemetry library and the Adafruit BMP183 SPI-barometric sensor library.


This code is higly unstable! Use at your own risk!

Everything is subject to change at the moment. I'll change the pinning (to reduce pin-change-interrupt usage) as soon as I've got my new MinimOSD and there will be also a new soldering manual.
